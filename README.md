# MyKay
MyKay is a property consultancy mobile app made by me, using React Native in the expo enviornment. The main functionality of this app is the offline login system created using the Asynchronous Storage. Aside from that the app is mostly UI.

To run the code frist install have installed:
- Node JS 
- NPM

Then, install the Expo CLI using the following command:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
Afterwards, open the project folder in CMD/terminal and run the following command to install all the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Lastly, in the same terminal, open the expo debug tool (to run the app in emulator/device) with the command:
```
npm start
```

## Enjoy
